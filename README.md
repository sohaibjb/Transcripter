# Transcripter
This Rep. shows how to use OpenAI's Whisper to transcribe a link from Youtube and audiovisual files, and how to save that transcription as a plain text file or as a VTT/SRT caption file.

You can choose the model of whisper between small, medium , large or Turbo. You can even change the language of the transcription.
